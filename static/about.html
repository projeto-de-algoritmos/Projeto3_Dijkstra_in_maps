            <h3>Software Engineer at <span>ShortCircuit Inc.</span> <span>(YC W2013)</span></h3>
            <p>September 2012 - March 2013</p> 
          </header>
          <p>At ShortCircuit, I worked on the real-time mass transit directions app <a href="m.roversf.com">Rover</a>. <span>I was</span> primarily responsible for the backend, which was mainly Python with Flask. Here are a few of the things <span>I created</span> for Rover:</p>
          <ul>
            <h4>Real-time mass transit routing algorithm</h4>
            <p>The algorithm was implemented based on a recently published research paper. It was a replacement for our older routing algorithm, with a performance increase of up to two orders of magnitude and significant savings in memory. This prevented a backend rewrite from Python to a performance language.</p>

            <h4>Walking directions for Open Street Maps</h4>
            <p>Shortest path algorithm which provided a visual guide for our users and distance calculations for the transit routing algorithm. Due to the size of OSM data and constraints of Heroku instances, I created a fast, dynamic loading scheme that prevented having to keep the entire graph in memory at once. The algorithm is also capable of handling problems caused by errors in the OSM data set itself, such as unintentional islands in the graph.</p>

            <h4>Backend Infrastructure</h4>
            <p>I implemented a majority of the current production backend from the ground up. This includes the aforementioned algorithms, logic for handling real-time data from various transit agencies, and tools for processing static data. I was also responsible for the production releases of my code to EC2 and Heroku, including the testing required to make launches go smoothly.</p>

        <h3>Projects/Awards</h3>
        <p>Some side projects I've done</p>
      </header>
        <ul>
          <h4><a href="/animate">Graph Search Animator</a></h4>
          <p>Animates three graph search algorithms: A* search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and the more recent A* Landmark Triangle Inequality algorithm, as well as their bidirectional variants. The animator illustrates the vertex scanning behavior that these algorithms take as they explore the graph. Take a look at the link above!</p>

	        <h4>Best Collaboration at Reroute/sf Hackathon</h4>
          <p>Created a heat map showing how far one could travel in 30 minutes in any direction by taking public transit, based on live data of bus positions. I adapted a breadth-first graph search algorithm to do the flood that created the data for the visualization.</p>

          <h4>DJ Display (Python/wxPython)</h4>
          <p>I created a program for Cheryl Burke Dance which allowed a DJ to display a list of ballroom dance types corresponding with the playing song. The display was timer-based, allowing the DJ to automate the display to match their play list. This replaced an older program which only allowed manual manipulation of the list.</p>
